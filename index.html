        <p>When Shouya Ishida was in elementary school, he was a wild child - always challenging himself, and his friends to conquer their fears by doing crazy tasks like jumping off of bridges. When a deaf girl, Shouko, transfers to his school, he finds her so weird that he and his friends bully her until she's forced to transfer out. As a result, the rest of the class turns on him and bullies him. As a high school student, he feels extreme remorse for what he did to Shouko, and hates himself and his life for what happened after.  He decides to find Shouko, apologize, and then kill himself after. But after meeting Shouko and receiving an acceptance of apology, he decides that his new purpose in life is to try to make up all the hardship he caused Shouko. </p>
